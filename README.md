# Overview
MealChk is a personal project I made for detecting potential artificial or processed ingredients, and can be used to help aid following a paleo, whole30, or clean-eating lifestyle.

Please note that due to the way manufacturers label food, in some cases some ingredients may not always be detected.

This tool should not be used alone, but rather to supplement other checks.

# How to use
To analyze an item, you can paste your ingredients list. Searching by photograph, android & iOS apps, and selecting between Paleo/Mediterranean diets is being considered in the future.

A hosted version of the app can be found at:
